        <p>Hi! my name is <strong>Justin Balgos</strong> I am from the <strong>Philippines.</strong> </p>
        <p>I am a <em>sophomore</em> studying at <strong>Brigham Young University Hawaii</strong></p>
        <p>I am majoring in <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> minoring in <abbr title="Entrepreneur">ENTRP</abbr> and <abbr title="Spanish">SPN</abbr></p>
        <p> One more thing, did you know that subscripts like H<sub>2</sub>O or CO<sub>2</sub> are common in scientific notation? </p>
        <p>I would like to share my readings from my religion class to you.</p>
        <p“No love in mortality comes closer to approximating the pure love of Jesus Christ than the selfless love a devoted mother has for her child. When Isaiah, speaking messianically, wanted to convey Jehovah’s love, he invoked the image of a mother’s devotion. ‘Can a woman forget her sucking child?’ he asks. How absurd, he implies, though not as absurd as thinking Christ will ever forget us.” <cite>—Jeffrey R. Holland, <em>Behold Thy Mother</em>, Oct. 2015</cite></p>
